# BlackMarket2
A black market weapons script for ESX

Just import the SQL and start it, Make sure all of the weapons inside the config are listed in es_extended\config.weapons.
If they are not you can either add them yourself or remove them from the BlackMarket config.

If you modify this and improve it please submit a push request with the changes so everyone can benefit :)
